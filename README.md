# **US Domestic Flights Data Analysis - 2013**
This project explores 2013 US domestic flight data to analyze factors contributing to flight delays. It was developed as a challenge after completing data exploration modules in Microsoft Learn, providing an opportunity to apply new skills and perform additional analyses beyond the initial requirements.

**Project Overview**
This analysis tackles several questions, including:

- Average departure and arrival delays.
- Comparison of carrier delay performance.
- Day-of-week patterns in delays.
- Airports and routes with the highest delays.
- Additional analyses were conducted to explore trends, building on the original challenge requirements to deepen understanding.

**Dataset**
Source: US Department of Transportation, 2013.
**Fields:**
Year, Month, Day of Month, Day of Week, Carrier, Origin and Destination Airports, Departure and Arrival Times, Delay Indicators, and Cancellation status.

**Insights**
This analysis highlights patterns such as:

- Carriers with the best and worst on-time performance.
- Days with higher delay likelihood.
- Specific airports and routes with consistent delay trends.
  
**Tools**
Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.
